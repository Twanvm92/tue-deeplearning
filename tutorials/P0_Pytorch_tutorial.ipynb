It was a precursor project to PyTorch and is no longer actively developed. PyTorch includes “Torch” in the name, acknowledging the prior torch library with the “Py” prefix indicating the Python focus of the new project.\n","\n","The PyTorch API is simple and flexible, making it a favorite for academics and researchers in the development of new deep learning models and applications. The extensive use has led to many extensions for specific applications (such as text, computer vision, and audio data), and many pre-trained models that can be used directly. As such, it may be the most popular library used by academics.\n","\n","The flexibility of PyTorch comes at the cost of ease of use, especially for beginners, as compared to simpler interfaces like Keras.
