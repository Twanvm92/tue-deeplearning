In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are\n","words! But how should you represent a word in a computer? You could\n","store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what\n","the word *is*, it doesn't say much about what it *means* (you might be\n","able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from\n","its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you\n","combine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our\n","neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where\n","$V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few\n","dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for\n","instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller\n","dimensional space?\n","\n","How about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\n","That is, we represent the word $w$ by\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\overbrace{\\left[ 0, 0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, 0 \\right]}^\\text{|V| elements}\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","where the 1 is in a location unique to $w$. Any other word will\n","have a 1 in some other location, and a 0 everywhere else.\n","\n","There is an enormous drawback to this representation, besides just how\n","huge it is. It basically treats all words as independent entities with\n","no relation to each other. What we really want is some notion of\n","*similarity* between words. Why? Let's see an example.\n","\n","Suppose we are building a language model. Suppose we have seen the\n","sentences\n","\n","* The mathematician ran to the store.\n","* The physicist ran to the store.\n","* The mathematician solved the open problem.\n","\n","in our training data. Now suppose we get a new sentence never before\n","seen in our training data:\n","\n","* The physicist solved the open problem.\n","\n","Our language model might do OK on this sentence, but wouldn't it be much\n","better if we could use the following two facts:\n","\n","- We have seen  mathematician and physicist in the same role in a sentence. Somehow they\n","  have a semantic relation.\n","* We have seen mathematician in the same role  in this new unseen sentence\n","  as we are now seeing physicist.\n","\n","and then infer that physicist is actually a good fit in the new unseen\n","sentence? This is what we mean by a notion of similarity: we mean\n","*semantic similarity*, not simply having similar orthographic\n","representations. It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic\n","data, by connecting the dots between what we have seen and what we\n","haven't. This example of course relies on a fundamental linguistic\n","assumption: that words appearing in similar contexts are related to each\n","other semantically. This is called the [distributional\n","hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NbrNBEqgd2es"},"source":["# Getting Dense Word Embeddings\n","\n","\n","How can we solve this problem? That is, how could we actually encode\n","semantic similarity in words? Maybe we think up some semantic\n","attributes. For example, we see that both mathematicians and physicists\n","can run, so maybe we give these words a high score for the \"is able to\n","run\" semantic attribute. Think of some other attributes, and imagine\n","what you might score some common words on those attributes.\n","\n","If each attribute is a dimension, then we might give each word a vector,\n","like this:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","q_\\text{mathematician} = \\left[ \\overbrace{2.3}^\\text{can run},\n","   \\overbrace{9.4}^\\text{likes coffee}, \\overbrace{-5.5}^\\text{majored in Physics}, \\dots \\right]\n"," \\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","q_\\text{physicist} = \\left[ \\overbrace{2.5}^\\text{can run},\n","   \\overbrace{9.1}^\\text{likes coffee}, \\overbrace{6.4}^\\text{majored in Physics}, \\dots \\right]\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","Then we can get a measure of similarity between these words by doing:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\text{Similarity}(\\text{physicist}, \\text{mathematician}) = q_\\text{physicist} \\cdot q_\\text{mathematician}\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","Although it is more common to normalize by the lengths:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\text{Similarity}(\\text{physicist}, \\text{mathematician}) = \\frac{q_\\text{physicist} \\cdot q_\\text{mathematician}}\n","   {\\| q_\\text{physicist} \\| \\| q_\\text{mathematician} \\|} = \\cos (\\phi)\\end{align}\n","\n","Where $\\phi$ is the angle between the two vectors. That way,\n","extremely similar words (words whose embeddings point in the same\n","direction) will have similarity 1. Extremely dissimilar words should\n","have similarity -1.\n","\n","\n","\n","You can think of the sparse one-hot vectors from the beginning of this\n","section as a special case of these new vectors we have defined, where\n","each word basically has similarity 0, and we gave each word some unique\n","semantic attribute. These new vectors are *dense*, which is to say their\n","entries are (typically) non-zero.\n","\n","But these new vectors are a big pain: you could think of thousands of\n","different semantic attributes that might be relevant to determining\n","similarity, and how on earth would you set the values of the different\n","attributes? Central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural\n","network learns representations of the features, rather than requiring\n","the programmer to design them herself. So why not just let the word\n","embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during\n","training? This is exactly what we will do. We will have some *latent\n","semantic attributes* that the network can, in principle, learn. Note\n","that the word embeddings will probably not be interpretable. That is,\n","although with our hand-crafted vectors above we can see that\n","mathematicians and physicists are similar in that they both like coffee,\n","if we allow a neural network to learn the embeddings and see that both\n","mathematicians and physicists have a large value in the second\n","dimension, it is not clear what that means. They are similar in some\n","latent semantic dimension, but this probably has no interpretation to\n","us.\n","\n","\n","In summary, **word embeddings are a representation of the *semantics* of\n","a word, efficiently encoding semantic information that might be relevant\n","to the task at hand**.
